# dataStructure
school projects
Every folder has an instruction provides the detail of how the program implements. Here is to briefly explain those programs meant to do.

** A1 **

PartA:
The program simulates the modified game of Uno by implementing LinkedList data structure.

Assign1PartA_Driver is the driver class that adds players and start running the game.

PartB:
The program is a simple version of calculator but with undo/redo feature.
Assign1PartB_Driver is the driver class that takes input from user and start running the program.


** A2 **

Text-based version of the classic board game Mastermind, where a single player is the code breaker, and the system is the code maker.
See details in the PDF instruction.

PartA:
MasterMind is the driver class/main program runs the game by taking inputs and iterates through the customized ArrayList data structure.

PartB:
This program simulates a Scoreboard that performs arbitrary insertion and deletion(an element can be easily inserted into/ deleted from the list without rearrange the rest of elements) by implementing positional list(which only takes O(1)-time).

** A3 **

Implement "Tree" data structure(hierarchical structure) which allows the program to run a host of algorithms much faster than using linear data structure(such as arrays).

PartA:
Demonstrate the hierarchical structure presentation by going through questions.

PartB:
Combine Tree, LinkedList, and other data Structure algorithm, so that the program reorganizes the data structure by moving the element to the place after an occurrence of insertion or deletion.
