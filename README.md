Leverage diverse data structures to develop interactive applications


Uno:
The program simulates the modified game of Uno by implementing LinkedList data structure.

Calculator:
The program is a simple version of calculator but with undo/redo feature.

MasterMind:
The program features an ArrayList holding randomly generated color codes and another for player guesses, with a game loop providing feedback until either the code is cracked or 12 unsuccessful attempts occur.

Scoreboard:
The program performs arbitrary insertion and deletion(an element can be easily inserted into/ deleted from the list without rearrange the rest of elements) by implementing positional list(which only takes O(1)-time).

YesNo_decisionAlgorithm:
Demonstrate the hierarchical structure presentation by going through questions.

AirLine_standby_list:
Combine Tree, LinkedList, and other data Structure algorithm, so that the program reorganizes the data structure by moving the element to the place after an occurrence of insertion or deletion.
